# OpenSpace-deb
Using dpkg-deb to convert the OpenSpace AppImage to deb

The `.github/workflows` directory has the github actions yml files which actually do the conversion.

Please see https://github.com/hn-88/OpenSpace-AppImage/tree/main/.github/workflows for workflows which use CPack to create .deb directly from the OpenSpace repository without converting to appimage first.
